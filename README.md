Scala orbit playground
======================

A Scala port of Uncle Bobs clojureOrbit as he [presented it to the Chicago JUG](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYeDxWKftfA).
His version is available at http://tinyurl.com/clojureOrbit


This is mostly for fun, to see how certain idiomatic clojure would translate to Scala.
Sometimes, a more clojure-esque Scala is written (e.g. using stuff `->>` und `@`), and sometimes, it's the other way around (e.g. using `isCollide` instead of `collide?`)
